# Maven Rail Challenge Power BI Dashboard


This dashboard project was created based on a challenge given by [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-rail-challenge/08941141-d23f-4cc9-93a3-4c25ed06e1c3). The challenge involved a scenario where I was given the role of BI Developer for a national railway company that provides passenger transportation services across England, Scotland, and Wales.

# Objective
Some of the information that managers hope to obtain through the created dashboard includes:
- Identify the most popular routes
- Determine peak travel times
- Analyze revenue from different ticket types & classes
- Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors

# Conclusion
1. there is no single day with a significantly higher number of transactions than others, Meanwhile, in terms of hours, it is clear that peak passenger times are divided into two periods: 6-8 am, and 4-6 pm
2. The Manchester Piccadillyâ€”Liverpool Lime Street route is one of the most popular, while Birmingham New Street is listed as one of the busiest stations.
3. The Standard Ticket Class contributes significantly to overall revenue, accounting for 80% ($592K). 
4. Among all ticket types, the Advanced Ticket Type generates the most revenue, contributing $309K, which is 42% of the total revenue.
5. With an on-time rate of 94%, the main causes of delays are technical and staff-related issues, indicating that there is room for improvement in on-time performance.
